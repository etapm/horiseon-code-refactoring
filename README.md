# horiseon-code-refactoring

## Description

My motivation for this assignment was to provide the most semantically appealing code so I could start to figure out my style. I built this project because I wanted to test how I could make code look cleaner while making it more accessible. The problem this project solved was providing more accessible code so that if someone else looked at it, the coder could pinpoint what was happening faster. Therefore, this project allows for a more accessible website. In addition, I learned the impact certain semantic tags have on the overall code.
